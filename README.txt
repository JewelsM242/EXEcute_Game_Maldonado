Project Name: EXEcute

Description: A three person project focused on creating a turn based game game that combines timing manipulation
with typical turn-based combat.

Timeline: Project was completed for a design course and completed within 3 months.

My Contribution: I participated as one of three programmers to the project.
My main responisibilites were to design and implement:
- A collection of "Actions" the player could take
- A Game Manager class that would keep track of the game state, load/reload assets, and allow for gameplay progression.
- Integration of the other programmers' works (and fixing any bugs that came as a result)

This is the full repository of the game; 
however, if you'd like to only see the game itself, the final build is also in this folder under "EXEcute_Build".
